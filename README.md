# UFOs

## Project Purpose
JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. The idea behind Javascript is that it enhances websites by providing front-end functionality, customization, and allowing for user input to create dynamic web pages. It helps make websites visually appealing and interactive. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.
In this repository, we will use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

### Goals
* Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
* Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
* Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

## Deliverables
* Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)
