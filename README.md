# UFOs

## Project Overview
JavaScript is a well-established coding language designed to improve webpages by enhancing the user experience. Javascript enhances websites by providing front-end functionality, customization, dashboards (such as maps or graphs), and allows for user input to create dynamic web pages. Javascript enables websites to be visually appealing and interactive. 

In this repository, we will use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

### Coding Goals
* Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
* Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
* Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML (convert a Javascript array into an HTML Table)

### Project Deliverables
* Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Results
* Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary
* In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
