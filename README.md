# UFOs

## Project Purpose
JavaScript is a well-established coding language designed to improve webpages by enhancing the user experience. Javascript enhances websites by providing front-end functionality, customization, dashboards (such as maps or graphs), and allows for user input to create dynamic web pages. Javascript enables websites to be visually appealing and interactive. 

In this repository, we will use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

### Goals
* Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
* Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
* Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML (conver a Javascript array into an HTML Table)

## Deliverables
* Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)
